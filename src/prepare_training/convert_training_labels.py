# Brief: This script convert the ground truth file into overlapnet format
# Input: ground truth file, [current_frame_idx, x_coord, y_coord, overlap], x_coord, y_coord are grid coordinates
# Output: OverlapNet training format: [current_frame_idx, reference_frame_idx, overlap, yaw_angle, x_coord, y_coord]
